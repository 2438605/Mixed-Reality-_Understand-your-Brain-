Welcome to the interactive brain exploration!

You can use your hands to reach out and touch the brain in front of you.  

When you find a part you want to explore, pinch it gently.  

This will separate that lobe from the rest of the brain so you can look inside and see more details.

Each lobe is color-coded.  

See the colored buttons on the side?  

When you press the button that matches the color of the lobe you’re holding,  you’ll hear its name and a short description.

To get the full experience, follow along with the audio guide.  

It will walk you through each lobe’s function, from decision-making to vision and beyond.

Ready to start exploring?  
-> Yes, let’s begin!
    Great! Reach out and pinch your first lobe to continue.
    <<jump begin>>
-> Not yet, I need to hear that again.
    No problem — let’s go over it once more.

The human brain — it’s about the size of two fists put together, weighs roughly 1.4 kilograms, and yet it runs everything you do.

It controls your movements, stores your memories, processes your thoughts, and even keeps your heart beating without you thinking about it.

Without your brain, you couldn’t speak, dream, or even recognize your best friend’s face.

It’s like the ultimate control center, made of billions of nerve cells that talk to each other in tiny electrical sparks.

Today, we’re going to explore the brain’s five major lobes — each with its own special powers.
By the end, you’ll know which part helps you make decisions, which lets you see the world, 
and which secretly processes your sense of taste.

Ready for the tour?
-> Yes, let’s go!
    <<jump FrontalLobe>>
-> Maybe later.
    No problem! We can explore anytime.

It's the boss of decision-making, planning, and controlling voluntry movements.
Its also where your personality lives. 
It also controls your voluntary movements through an area called the motor cortex.  
When you speak, you can thank a special part here called Broca’s area for helping you form words.  
And, perhaps most importantly, the frontal lobe plays a big role in shaping your emotions, personality, and social behavior.

Fun Fact , damage to this can completely change how a person acts or reacts to things.

<<jump ParietalLobe>>

The "parietal lobe" is like your brain's touch and taste center. It is like your your brain's GPS, helping you understand where your body is in space and how to move it.
It processes touch sensations, like feeling a soft blanket or the warmth of the sun on your skin. 
It also helps you understand where your body is in space, so you can touch your nose with your eyes closed or catch a ball without looking. 

Lets keeps going to the next lobe!

<<jump temporallobe>>

The "temporal lobe" is like your brain's music and memory center.
Its your sound and memory center - helps your understand language an remember stuff.
It's also where you recognize faces and understand what people are saying.

<<jump occipitallobe >>

The "occipital lobe" is like your brain's movie screen.
It processes everything you see, from colors to shapes to movement.
When you look at a beautiful sunset or read a book, it’s the occipital lobe that makes sense of those images.

It’s also where your brain puts together all the visual information it gets from your eyes, so you can see the world clearly.

<<jump prefrontal>>

Next, let's zoom in on the very front tip of the frontal lobe. 

Think of it as the CEO's desk inside the brian's head office. 
This is where the big, complex thinking happens.
It helps you plan for the future, make decisions and weighs pros and cons.
It also acts like a brake pedal, helping you control impuses so you dont just do the first thing that pops into your head. 
When you're remembering something just long enough to use it-like a phone number before you dial-it's the prefrontal cortex that helps you keep that information in mind.
It even shapes your social behavior and personality, guiding how you interact with people and read social cues.

Fun fact, this part of the brian isnt fully development until your mid twenties, which is why teenagers sometimes make impulsive decisions.

Now that you know about different lobes, let's take a closer look at the internal structures of the brain.

Use your hands to gently separate the lobes of the brain. Pull them apart carefully until the inner structures become visible.
Once you’ve opened up the brain, press the buttons to discover each part.
Lets start with Cerebellum.
<<jump cerebellum>>

The cerebellum is like the brain's balance and coordination center.
It helps you keep your balance when you walk, ride a bike, or dance.
It’s also responsible for fine motor skills, like writing or playing an instrument.
When you learn a new skill, like riding a bike, the cerebellum helps you practice until it becomes second nature.
Without it, walking or even holding a cup steady would be tough!

Lets move on to the next part, the brainstem.

<<jump brainstem>>

Now, look at the brainstem — that stalk-like structure right at the center bottom, under the brain.

It’s the vital connection between your brain and spinal cord, managing life-essential functions like breathing and heartbeat. It’s a true life-support hub.
The brainstem is like the brain's autopilot.
It controls all the automatic functions that keep you alive, like breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure.
It’s also responsible for basic reflexes, like blinking when something comes close to your eyes or pulling your hand away from something hot.

lets jump over to the thalamus.
<<jump thalamus>>

Here’s the thalamus and the surrounding midbrain structures, the central bulge just above the brainstem.

Think of it as the brain’s relay station — it channels sensory information to the cerebral cortex so you can make sense of the world. 

It’s like a traffic cop, directing signals from your senses to the right parts of the brain.
