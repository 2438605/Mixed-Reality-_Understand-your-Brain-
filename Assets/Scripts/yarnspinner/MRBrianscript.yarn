Welcome to the interactive brain exploration! #line:030d5ea 

You can use your hands to reach out and touch the brain in front of you.   #line:0ec0b77 

When you find a part you want to explore, pinch it gently.   #line:062335a 

This will separate that lobe from the rest of the brain so you can look inside and see more details. #line:0cd2df5 

Each lobe is color-coded.   #line:0717218 

See the colored buttons on the side?   #line:04b5e8f 

When you press the button that matches the color of the lobe you’re holding,  you’ll find its name written. #line:0ad49cb 

To get the full experience, follow along with the audio guide.   #line:04f78f3 

It will walk you through each lobe’s function, from decision-making to vision and beyond. #line:02d052b 

Ready to start exploring?   #line:0e0ce56 
-> Yes, let’s begin! #line:0816349 
    Great! Lets start with your first lobe  #line:0d23009 
    <<jump begin>>
-> Not yet, I need to hear that again. #line:0101e0f 
    No problem — let’s go over it once more. #line:05f868f

The human brain — it’s about the size of two fists put together, weighs roughly 1.4 kilograms, and yet it runs everything you do. #line:0d45de9 

It controls your movements, stores your memories, processes your thoughts, and even keeps your heart beating without you thinking about it. #line:07dcae6 

Without your brain, you couldn’t speak, dream, or even recognize your best friend’s face. #line:0d7ddef 

It’s like the ultimate control center, made of billions of nerve cells that talk to each other in tiny electrical sparks. #line:0467ba8 

Today, we’re going to explore the brain’s five major lobes — each with its own special powers. #line:0d0705c 
By the end, you’ll know which part helps you make decisions, which lets you see the world, and which secretly processes your sense of taste. #line:074c391 

Ready for the tour? #line:0f8cdf2 
-> Yes, let’s go! #line:0df7d94 
    <<jump FrontalLobe>>
-> Maybe later. #line:0a3a993 
    No problem! We can explore anytime. #line:055f32f

Let's begin with the frontal lobe! It's the boss of decision-making, planning, and controlling voluntry movements. Its also where your personality lives.  #line:04a357a 
It also controls your voluntary movements through an area called the motor cortex.   #line:0cc0e23 
When you speak, you can thank a special part here called Broca’s area for helping you form words.   #line:0f54db3 
And, perhaps most importantly, the frontal lobe plays a big role in shaping your emotions, personality, and social behavior. #line:0a5040d 

Fun Fact , damage to this can completely change how a person acts or reacts to things. #line:06a3455 

<<jump ParietalLobe>>

The "parietal lobe" is like your brain's touch and taste center. It is like your your brain's GPS, helping you understand where your body is in space and how to move it. #line:0bdb34d 
It processes touch sensations, like feeling a soft blanket or the warmth of the sun on your skin.  #line:0d07134 
It also helps you understand where your body is in space, so you can touch your nose with your eyes closed or catch a ball without looking.  #line:0e71c25 

Lets keeps going to the next lobe! #line:0f30b18 

<<jump temporallobe>>

The "temporal lobe" is like your brain's music and memory center. It helps your understand language an remember stuff. #line:0478305 
It's also where you recognize faces and understand what people are saying. #line:075827f 

<<jump occipitallobe >>
===
title: occipitallobe
tags:

The "occipital lobe" is like your brain's movie screen. It processes everything you see, from colors to shapes to movement. #line:05ad95d 
When you look at a beautiful sunset or read a book, it’s the occipital lobe that makes sense of those images. #line:0d5e799 

It’s also where your brain puts together all the visual information it gets from your eyes, so you can see the world clearly. #line:0274d95 

<<jump prefrontal>>

Next, let's zoom in on the very front tip of the frontal lobe.  #line:0f06808 

Think of it as the CEO's desk inside the brian's head office. This is where the big, complex thinking happens. #line:06b7d25 
It helps you plan for the future, make decisions and weighs pros and cons. It also acts like a brake pedal, helping you control impuses so you dont just do the first thing that pops into your head.  #line:0a08cf8 
When you're remembering something just long enough to use it-like a phone number before you dial-it's the prefrontal cortex that helps you keep that information in mind. #line:075aecc 
It even shapes your social behavior and personality, guiding how you interact with people and read social cues. #line:0904ae5 

Fun fact, this part of the brian isnt fully development until your mid twenties, which is why teenagers sometimes make impulsive decisions. #line:0432e92 
<<jump internal >>

Now that you know about different lobes, let's take a closer look at the internal structures of the brain. #line:013cd3b 
If you have still not seperated the lobes, pinch over them and seperate it. Realse the pinch at different location once you have the internal part visible. #line:0f8b1c2
Once you’ve opened up the brain, press the buttons to discover each part. #line:0eb4d97 
Lets start with Cerebellum. #line:0a212de 
<<jump cerebellum>>
===
title: cerebellum
tags:

The cerebellum is like the brain's balance and coordination center. It helps you keep your balance when you walk, ride a bike, or dance. #line:03807f8 
It’s also responsible for fine motor skills, like writing or playing an instrument. When you learn a new skill, like riding a bike, the cerebellum helps you practice until it becomes second nature. #line:0be89c7 
Without it, walking or even holding a cup steady would be tough! #line:0773ac5 

Lets move on to the next part, the brainstem. #line:08905e7 

<<jump brainstem>>
===
title: brainstem
tags:

Now, look at the brainstem — that stalk-like structure right at the center bottom, under the brain. #line:0012915 

It’s the vital connection between your brain and spinal cord, managing life-essential functions like breathing and heartbeat. It’s a true life-support hub. #line:0e13ba8 
The brainstem is like the brain's autopilot. It controls all the automatic functions that keep you alive, like breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure. #line:088011e 
It’s also responsible for basic reflexes, like blinking when something comes close to your eyes or pulling your hand away from something hot. #line:0769a00 

lets jump over to the thalamus. #line:0c3affc 
<<jump thalamus>>
===
title: thalamus
tags:

Here’s the thalamus and the surrounding midbrain structures, the central bulge just above the brainstem. #line:001bed5 

Think of it as the brain’s relay station — it channels sensory information to the cerebral cortex so you can make sense of the world. It’s like a traffic cop, directing signals from your senses to the right parts of the brain. #line:06c7b76 

Hope you now have a better understanding of the brain's  structures! Let's wrap up our journey through the brain. #line:0d5e79a

Did you enjoy exploring the brain? #line:0f8cdf3
-> Yes, it was fascinating! #line:0df7d95 
    I’m glad you enjoyed it! The brain is truly amazing. #line:0a3a994 
    <<stop>>
-> No, I didn't find it interesting. #line:0a3a995
    That’s okay! Lets start over again #line:055f330
